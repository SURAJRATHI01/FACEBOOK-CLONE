CSS Styling
Global Styles:

The body selector sets the background color of the entire webpage to a light grayish-blue (#e9ebee).
Textareas and form controls have their borders removed, border radius set to 0, and resizing disabled.
Topbar Styles:

The .topbar class styles the top navigation bar to be fixed at the top of the viewport with a blue background and a dark blue bottom border.
The right group within the topbar is floated to the right, containing link groups and notification groups.
Links within the topbar have white text, padding, and a font size of 12 pixels. On hover, the background color changes to a darker blue (#355486) and text decoration is removed.
Link groups within the right group are displayed as inline-block elements with no padding.
Image icons within links are displayed inline-block with a specific width and height.
Left Content and Feed Content:

The left content section is fixed on the left side of the viewport with a specific width, background color, and overflow set to auto.
Global links within the left content have specific styling for text and icons, along with a counter for notifications.
The feed content section is positioned to the right of the left content with padding, background color, and overflow set to auto.
Third Column Content:

The third column content is fixed on the right side of the viewport with a specific width, background color, and overflow set to auto.
It contains various sections with borders, headings, and links.
Media Queries:

Media queries are used to adjust the layout and styling based on the screen width.
When the screen width is less than 700px, the left content is hidden and certain link groups in the topbar are hidden.
When the screen width is less than 1000px, the third column content is hidden.
When the screen width is greater than or equal to 1260px, additional content is displayed on the right side.
Technical Buzzwords:

Selectors: body, .topbar, .right-group, .link-group, a, img, textarea, .form-control.
Properties: position, background-color, color, font-size, padding, margin, border, width, height, overflow, float, display, transition, outline, text-align, list-style, border-radius.
Values: Colors in hexadecimal format (#e9ebee), lengths in pixels (px), positions (fixed, relative), and various keywords (none, inline-block, auto).
script.js
Bootstrap Library: The first <script> tag loads the Bootstrap library from a Content Delivery Network (CDN) hosted at //cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/4.0.0-alpha.6/js/bootstrap.min.js. This library provides pre-designed components and styles for building responsive web pages.

Custom Script: The second <script> tag loads a custom JavaScript file named script.js from the current directory (./). This is where you would typically place your own JavaScript code to add interactivity or functionality to your webpage.

Anonymous Function: The JavaScript code inside script.js is wrapped in an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) using (function() { ... })();. This encapsulates the code within its own scope, preventing it from polluting the global namespace and avoiding conflicts with other scripts.

Function Invocation: The IIFE is immediately invoked using .call(this) to execute its code as soon as the script is loaded. This ensures that any initialization or setup logic inside the function is executed promptly.

Execution Context: By using .call(this), the current execution context (this) is passed into the IIFE. This allows the code inside the function to access properties and methods of the current context, which could be the global window object or another context depending on where the script is loaded.

In summary, this HTML setup loads the Bootstrap library for styling and functionality, along with a custom JavaScript file (script.js) containing code wrapped in an IIFE for encapsulation and immediate execution. This structure ensures that your webpage has access to Bootstrap features and your custom JavaScript logic as soon as it loads.
